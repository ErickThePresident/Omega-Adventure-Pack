# Omega Adventure Pack Server Deployment

There are two different ways to set up a Minecraft server, either by installing it on a computer running either Microsoft Windows or Linux. The purpose of this document is to help you set up the Omega Adventure Pack with the assumption of a reasonable level of prior knowledge of the operating system that you choose to use to deploy the server onto.  If you have any additional questions and/or concerns, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FKmGguMz&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHFXE7b1nuhdnnZnT3OCjdJ0uLmtw).

### Prerequisites
- You will need the 64-Bit Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer in order to be able to allocate more than 4GB of RAM to your dedicated server.  Any less than 8GB of RAM can cause server instability with this modpack.  Download the 64-Bit Java JRE [Here](https://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=240728_5b13a193868b4bf28bcb45c792fce896).
  

### Downloading the Latest Server Release
- Download the latest release of Omega Adventure Pack from the [Releases](https://github.com/cyberstrawberry101/Omega-Adventure-Pack/releases) page.  The file you will need is named "**Source Code.zip**".
- Extract the ZIP archive in the directory that you will be running your server from on your computer.  

### Installation
- Within the newly-created directory, navigate inside the "**Server Converter**" folder, and run the "**Install Windows Server.bat**" script.
You will be prompted to choose how many system resources to allocate to the server along with other customizable information, such as server name, max players, and world seed.  The script will automatically copy the necessary server files to their correct locations and delete the client-sided mods.
- Use the "**Launch_Server.bat**" script (located in the main folder) to start the Minecraft server.
